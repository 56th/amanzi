/* ******************************************************************
Operator whose unknowns are CELL + FACE, but which assembles the CELL only
system and Schur complements the face.

This uses special assembly.  Apply is done as if we had the full FACE+CELL
system.  SymbolicAssembly() is done as if we had the CELL system, but with an
additional step to get the layout due to the Schur'd system on FACE+CELL.
Assemble, however, is done using a totally different approach.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Operator is a linear operator acting from linear space X to linear
space Y. These spaces are described by CompositeVectors (CV). A few
maps X->Y is supported. 

At the moment X = Y. Extension to TreeVectors should not be done in 
this class.

2. Operator is an un-ordered additive collection of lower-rank (or 
equal) simple operators. During its construction, an operator can 
only grow by assimilating more operators. 

At the moment, an operator cannot be split into two operators, but
there are no desing restriction for doing it in the future.

3. A simple operator (a set of 1 operators) is defined by triple:
scheme + elemental matrices + diagonal matrix. The schema specifies
structure of elemental matrices, e.g. cell-based matrices 
representing interation between face-based unknowns.

4. Operator can be converted to Epetra_FECrsMatrix matrix to generate
a preconditioner. This operation cannot be applied to a subset of
defining operators. 
 
Note. The operators can be initialized from other operators.
    Since data are never copied by default, we have to track 
    down the ownership of data.
