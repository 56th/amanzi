 Amanzi Examples
===============================================

This directory contains a collection of examples that showcase the
capabilities of Amanzi.  Here we use a very inclusive definition of
the word "example" and include our sequence of problems used to prepare
for the demonstration simulations, as well as verification problems.
In addition we plan to include the tutorial examples from the User
Guide here.

The high-level directory structure is as follows:

  * phase1     -  Phase 1 demonstration examples
     * f-area    -  Savannah River F-Area
  * phase2     - Phase 2 demonstration examples
     * dvz       -  BC Cribs Deep Vadose Zone 
     * f-area    -  Savannah River F-Area
     * tanks     -  Representative Waste Tanks for Savannah River
  * python     - Python generation testing/examples (not supported yet). 
  * verification 
     * flow    -  Flow focused tests 
     * transport - Transport focused tests (to be added soon)
     * chemistry - Geochemistry (to be added soon)
  * tutorial  (to be added soon)

The naming conventions of subsequent directories and files still needs
work.  A starting point is in phase2/dvz/ where we have a convention of

 problem_string_{1d|2d}-{s|u}

for directory names. Although the structured and unstructured input
files are very similar, it seems best to explictily call out which an
input file will invoke.  So in some cases this distinction may be made
only a the file level, with files of both types in a single generically
named directory.
