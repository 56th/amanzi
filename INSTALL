AMANZI: Building / Installing / Running
=============================================================================

The User Guide is available at

  https://software.lanl.gov/ascem/internal/amanzi/UserGuide

and provide the easiest way to click through what you would like to
read about. Nevertheless all of this content is in this source tree.

-----------------------
Building and Installing
-----------------------

Amanzi can be built with standard C++/C/Fortran compiler families
(GCC, Intel, Clang + gfortran) and a standard MPI library (Mpich,
OpenMPI).  It uses CMake for its build system.

In addition, Amanzi, depends on several Third Party Libraries (TPLs),
including Trilinos and PETSc, and so special instructions for our
TPL metabuilder "bootstrap.sh" can be found in 

doc/building_instructions/building_bootstrap.rst

Also, you can get help with 

./bootstrap.sh --help

Note the bootstrap metabuilder will download the currently supported
version of all the TPLs for you, and hence requires about 3.5GB of 
available diskspae (350MB for the downloads, then upacking and building),
and the build of Amanzi requires another 2.2G of diskspace if all the
tests are built and linked.

-------
Running
-------

The instructions for getting started and running Amanzi are included
in the User Guide (link included above), and can be found in

doc/user_guide/background/getting_started.rst

Amanzi comes with a number of tests that are used to generate the User
Guide.  These are in testing/verification and testing/benchmarking
users are encouraged to play around with them.  These tests include
python scripts that run Amanzi, and plot the results.
