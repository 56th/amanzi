* Geochemical reactions

	* Aqueous complexation reactions (equilibrium)
	* Mineral dissolution

Introduction
------------

Carbonate minerals are present in many subsurface environments and contribute to their buffering capacity. Under typical subsurcace flow conditons, calcite dissolution is a relatively fast geochemical reaction leading often to local geochemical equilibrium and sharp dissolution fronts. Calcite dissolution is represented with a kinetic rate expression based on the transition state theory. In this test example, a solution under saturated with calcite is injected at x=0 into a 100-m porous domain containing calcite; as a result, calcite dissolves raising the pH and concentration of cations at the effluent of the domain. The simulation is run to 100 years.

Aqueous complexation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Six reactions equilibrium reactions are considered in aqueous phase

Saturated 3-D Steady-State Test Flow Problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Horizontal flow in the **x-direction**

* Model domain:

	* :math:`X_{min} = Y_{min} = Z_{min} = 0`
	* :math:`Y_{max} = Z_{max} = 50` *meters*

* Model domain: 10 meters X 5 meters X 5 meters

* Total flow applied (flux) at **x = 0 plane** is *1.95E-2* 
  :math:`kg/s/m^2`

* Constant head specified at **x = 100 meters plane**: 120 meters 

* Uniform Intrinsic Permeability, 
  :math:`\kappa =` *1.0E-12*
  :math:`m^2`

* Water Viscosity,
  :math:`\mu =` *1.002E-3 Pa - s*

* Water Density,
  :math:`\rho =` *998.2*
  :math:`kg/m^3`

Expected result, according to Darcy's Law
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Darcy's Law is defined as: 

.. math:: Q/A = -K \frac{dh}{dx}

which, in this case, is based on isotropic soil conductivity, *K*, and the hydraulic head gradient in the x-direction.  

Calculated head gradient (-): ?

Calculated hydraulic conductivity:

.. math:: K = \kappa \rho g / \mu = 9.67*10^{-6} \frac{m}{s}

         \frac{Q}{A} = \frac{1.95*10^{-2}}{998.2} \frac{kg/s/m^2}{kg/m^3} = 9.76*10^{-6} \frac{m}{s}

**Pressure p(x,z)** = 
:math:`[ h(x) - z ]\rho g`

Tables are the one weakness in reStructured text, but they are 
reasonable.  We will autogenerate these from the results of the
Amanzi run and the analytic solution calculations.
