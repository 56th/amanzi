Introduction
------------

When running a reactive transport problem, it is good practice to include a non-reactive component or tracer. Comparison of results for components subject to geochemical reactions with resutls for this conservative tracer can be used to investigate the effects of reactions on the fate of the geochemical species, e.g. retardation of species subject to sorption. The problem presented here is for conservative advective transport of a single component. The flow and transport components of this test are used in the following test problems: 1d-tritium, 1d-calcite, 1d-ion-exchange, 1d-surface-complexation, 1d-farea-full

Flow and Transport
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The flow equation solved is the steady state fully saturated flow equation (placeholder: reference).
The transport equation solved is the transient advective transport equation (placeholder: reference).

* Horizontal flow in the **x-direction**

* Model domain length: 100 meters

	* :math:`X_{min} = 0`
	* :math:`X_{max} = 100` *meters*

* Discretized with 100 cells in the **x-direction**, 1 meter each. 

* Uniform flow velocity in x-direction  *7.91317859E-6* 
  :math:`kg/s/m^3`
  (or *7.927E-9*
  :math: `kg/s/m^3`)
  specified as mass flux boundary conditions ("BC: Flux") at the the two ends of the domain 
  :math:`X_{min} = 0 m, X_{max} = 100 m`
  so that it takes 1 year for water to move across 1 cell of the discretization. Flow is solve to steady state before starting the transport solve ("")

* Simulation time = 50 years
 
* The concentration of the tracer is set to *1E-20* mol/L initially everywhere in the domain. At time 0, a tracer concentration of *1E-3* mol/L is injected during the entire simulation time (50 years).


Expected results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

The flow solution is trivial with flow velocity 
The advective front moves with the The transport solution is . This solution is compared to results obtained with PFlotran (see below).
