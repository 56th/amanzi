Testing

Introduction

Background Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Advanced Simulation Capabilities for Environmental Management (ASCEM) High Performance Computing (HPC) simulator, Amanzi, has the capacity to simulate pumping tests in confined and unconfined aquifers.  The capabilites of Amanzi include but are not limited to: 

* Transient Dacry flow with adaptice time stepping
* Application of the specific yield term in cells representing unconfined conditions at the water table along the top of the model and specific storage at other cells
* Source/sink terms
* hydraulic head boundary conditions

These capabilities have been benchmarked using an analytical solution and an exisitng numerical code.  

Motivation for executing these tests is to ensure the capability of Amanzi.  The ASCEM team can gain a better understanding of the capabilty and functionality of the simulation.  

Test Site
~~~~~~~~~~

The Pahute Mesa, Nevada National Security Site (NNSS) is where preliminary testing will occur.  This is based on the extenstive nuclear underground testing that has taken place in this area.  Parameters will extracted using Amanzi to model the fate and transport of contaminats. 

This will aid efforts for determining proper remedial efforts to preserve the ground water that feeds into Clark County, a population of just over 2 millon people (clarkcountynv.gov).
