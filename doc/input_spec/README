Amanzi Input File Specfication
================================

The Input File Specfication is in the restructured text format
in the file AmanziInputSpec.rst.  The contents are simply the
old file, we need to decide what needs to change to make it a 
spec, and what new content to add before June 30.  

This file is rendered on the Trac/wiki directly from the source
repository. However, for development of the text, locally we need to
be able to build html or pdf versions.  We may distribute PDF versions
anyway.  The catch is that the base docutils tool does not support the
..code-block directive that we need to render XML.

To work around this we use a wrapper to rst2html, and rst2latex
that registers this directive and then uses pygments to do the
sytax highlighting.  These wrappers are called 

  rst2html-pygments
  rst2latex-pygments

and are available on the web

http://docutils.sourceforge.net/sandbox/code-block-directive/

For the short term I've put these wrappers along with style
sheets/files in the code-block subdirectory.  There is a rudimentary
Makefile there to help those using Unix based systems.  To create html
that you can view locally in a browser use

make html

and to make PDF use

make pdf

to clean up the mess

make clean

---------------------------

Portability at this point is less than ideal here, but its a start.
We should probably consider scons for building this stuff and work
on improving portability of these wrappers.
