  abstract     = {Accurate model predictions of water flow and solute
                  transport in unsaturated soils require a correct
                  representation of relevant mechanisms in a
                  mathematical model, as well as correct solutions of
                  the mathematical equations. Because of the
                  complexity of boundary conditions and the
                  nonlinearity of the processes considered, general
                  solutions of the mathematical equations rely on
                  numerical approximations. We evaluate a number of
                  numerical models (WAVE, HYDRUS_1D, SWAP, MARTHE, and
                  MACRO) that use different numerical methods to solve
                  the flow and transport equations. Our purpose is to
                  give an overview of analytical solutions that can be
                  found for simple initial and boundary conditions and
                  to define benchmark scenarios to check the accuracy
                  of numerical solutions. Included are analytical
                  solutions for coupled transport equations that
                  describe flow and transport in dual-velocity
                  media. The relevance of deviations observed in the
                  analytical benchmarks for more realistic boundary
                  conditions is illustrated an intercode comparison
                  for natural boundary conditions. For the water flow
                  scenarios, the largest deviations between numerical
                  models and analytical solutions were observed for
                  the case of soil limited evaporation. The intercode
                  differences could be attributed to the
                  implementation of the evaporation boundary
                  condition: the spatial discretization and the
                  internode averaging of the hydraulic conductivity in
                  the surface grid layer. For solute transport,
                  accurate modeling of solute dispersion poses the
                  most problems. Nonlinear and nonequilibrium sorption
                  and coupled transport in pore domains with different
                  advection velocities are in general accurately
                  simulated.}
