                 capable of solving these linear systems with an

                 methods construct the multigrid hierarchy based only

  abstract    = {An important constraint on our ability to simulate
                 physical processes numerically is our ability to
                 solve the resulting linear systems.  Multiscale
                 methods, such as multigrid, provide optimal or
                 near-optimal order solution techniques for a wide
                 range of problems.  Current multigrid methods (both
                 geometric and algebraic) rely on the use of effective
                 coarse-scale operators to achieve this efficiency.
                 Classical geometric multigrid methods construct these
                 operators based on the geometry of a given problem
                 and are, thus, most effective when this geometry is
                 known and simple.  Algebraic multigrid methods are
                 free from most geometric constraints, instead relying
                 on assumptions about the character of the matrix that
                 limit the applicability of such methods to a
                 relatively small class of problems.
                 In this thesis, we first study the applicability of
                 multigrid methods to the problem of flow through
                 porous media, particularly motivated by the size of
                 the linear systems resulting from discretization.
                 For such problems, it is well known how to construct
                 effective coarse-scale models for a correction-based
                 multigrid method.  For these robust multigrid
                 solvers, we consider whether sufficient information
                 is contained in the multigrid hierarchy to allow for
                 efficient approximation of solutions of these linear
                 systems.  In particular, we examine important
                 properties of the coarse-scale operators and the
                 solutions to these coarse-scale equations and
                 demonstrate their relevance to both the fine-scale
                 and continuum-scale models.
                 Additionally, we consider the question of
                 improvements to multigrid algorithms in the form of
                 adaptivity or self-correction.  By utilizing the
                 multigrid method itself to expose slow-to-converge
                 components, we may adapt the multigrid hierarchy in
                 order to improve performance, resulting in enhanced
                 efficiency for a new class of problems.  We present
                 results for both the classical algebraic multigrid
                 and smoothed aggregation frameworks illustrating
                 typical multigrid efficiency with fewer assumptions
                 on the given matrix systems.  We consider theoretical
                 issues of this adaptive procedure in the
                 reduction-based algebraic multigrid setting.  },

  abstract  = {Driven by the need to solve linear systems arising from
               problems posed on extremely large, unstructured grids,
               there has been a recent resurgence of interest in
               algebraic multigrid (AMG). AMG is attractive in that it
               holds out the possibility of multigrid-like performance
               on unstructured grids. The sheer size of many modem
               physics and simulation problems has led to the
               development of massively parallel computers, and has
               sparked much research into developing algorithms for
               them. Parallelizing AMG is a difficult task, however
               While much of the AMG method parallelizes readily, the
               process of coarse-grid selection, in particular, is
               fundamentally sequential in nature. We have previously
               introduced a parallel algorithm (1998) for the
               selection of coarse-grid points, based on modifications
               of certain parallel independent set algorithms and the
               application of heuristics designed to insure the
               quality of the coarse grids, and shown results from a
               prototype serial version of the algorithm. In this
               paper we describe an implementation of a parallel AMG
               code, using the algorithm of A.J. Cleary et al. (1998)
               as well as other approaches to parallelizing the
               coarse-grid selection. We consider three basic
               coarsening schemes and certain modifications to the
               basic schemes, designed to address specific performance
               issues. We present numerical results for a broad range
               of problem sizes and descriptions, and draw conclusions
               regarding the efficacy of the method. Finally, we
               indicate the current directions of the research.}

                 grids, in 2D and 3D. While sequential AMG has been
                 used for increasingly large problems (with several
                 million unknowns), its application to even larger
                 applications requires a parallel version. Since, in
                 contrast to geometric multigrid, the hierarchy of
                 coarser levels and the related operators develop
                 dynamically during the setup phase of AMG, a direct
                 parallelization is very complicated. Moreover, a
                 "naive" parallelization would, in general, require
                 unpredictable and highly complex communication

  abstract    = {Since the early nineties there has been a strongly
                 increasing demand for more efficient methods to solve
                 large sparse and unstructured linear systems of
                 equations.  For practically relevant problem sizes
                 classical one-level methods had already
                 reached their limits and new hierarchical algorithms
                 had to be developed in order to allow an efficient
                 solution of even larger problems.  The purpose of this
                 paper is to give an elementary introduction to the
                 first hierarchical and purely matrix-based
                 approach, algebraic multigrid (AMG).  The main idea behind
                 AMG is to extend the classical ideas of geometric
                 multigrid (smoothing and coarse-grid correction) to
                 certain classes of algebraic systems of equations.
                 Besides its robustness and efficiency, the main practical
                 advantage of AMG is that it can directly be applied,
                 for instance, to solve various types of elliptic
                 partial dierential equations discretized on
                 unstructured meshes, both in 2D and 3D. Since AMG does
                 not make use of any geometric information it is a
                 "plug-in" solver which can even be applied to problems
                 without any geometric background, provided that the
                 underlying matrix satisfies certain properties.  Although
                 the development of AMG goes back to the early
                 eighties, it still provides one of the most efficient
                 algebraic methods to solve corresponding problems.
                 Compared to the original approach, however, several
                 modications and extensions have been introduced.  In
                 addition to the theoretical basics of AMG, we present
                 a concrete algorithm in some detail and demonstrate
                 its robustness and efficiency by means of a variety of
                 typical applications.},
