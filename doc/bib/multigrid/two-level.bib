  abstract    = {Proposes a black-box parallel iterative method that is
                 suitable for solving both elliptic and certain
                 non-elliptic problems discretized on unstructured
                 meshes. The method is analyzed in the case of the
                 second-order elliptic problems discretized on
                 quasi-uniform P1 and Q1 finite-element meshes. The
                 numerical experiments confirm the validity of the
                 proved convergence estimate and show that the method
                 can successfully be used for more difficult problems
                 (e.g. plates, shells and the Helmholtz equation in
                 the high-frequency domain).}

  abstract    = {We propose an abstract two-grid algorithm with
                 convergence independent of the coarse-space size. The
                 abstract algorithm is applied to problems of
                 three-dimensional linear elasticity discretized on
                 unstructured meshes. With no regularity assumptions
                 we prove uniform convergence with respect to
                 coarse-space size, domain, essential boundary
                 conditions, and jumps in Young modulus. Numerical
                 experiments confirm the theory and show that the
                 method works well even if some assumptions of the
                 theory are violated.}
