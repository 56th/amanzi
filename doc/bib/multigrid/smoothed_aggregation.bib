                 parallel algebraic multigrid (AMG) preconditioners
                 for structural mechanics applications. In particular,
                 we are interested in investigating both the
                 scalability and robustness of the
                 preconditioners. Numerical results are given for a
                 range of structural mechanics problems with various
                 degrees of difficulty, and they show that algebraic
                 multigrid methods can be applied successfully even to
                 difficult problems in structural mechanics.}

                  described in the case of a general elliptic
                  system. The condition number bound increases only as
                  a polynomial of the number of levels, and requires
                  only a uniform weak approximation property for the

                  verified computationally once the aggregates are

                 basis functions in algebraic multigrid by minimizing

                 that linear combinations of the basis functions equal
                 to given zero energy modes, and subject to
                 restrictions on the supports of the coarse basis
                 functions. For a particular selection of the
                 supports, the first iteration gives exactly the same
                 basis functions as our earlier method using smoothed
                 aggregation. The convergence rate of the minimization
                 algorithm is bounded independently of the mesh size
                 under usual assumptions on finite elements. The

                 as for linear elasticity. Computational results on

                 algebraic multigrid performance and yields a more
