  abstract    = {Gauss-Seidel is often the smoother of choice within
                 multigrid applications. In the context of
                 unstructured meshes, however, maintaining good
                 parallel efficiency is difficult with multiplicative
                 iterative methods such as Gauss-Seidel. This leads us
                 to consider alternative smoothers. We discuss the
                 computational advantages of polynomial smoothers
                 within parallel multigrid algorithms for positive
                 definite symmetric systems. Two particular
                 polynomials are considered: Chebyshev and a
                 multilevel specific polynomial. The advantages of
                 polynomial smoothing over traditional smoothers such
                 as Gauss-Seidel are illustrated on several
                 applications: Poisson's equation, thin-body
                 elasticity, and eddy current approximations to
                 Maxwell's equations. While parallelizing the
                 Gauss-Seidel method typically involves a compromise
                 between a scalable convergence rate and maintaining
                 high flop rates, polynomial smoothers achieve
                 parallel scalable multigrid convergence rates without
                 sacrificing flop rates. We show that, although
                 parallel computers are the main motivation,
                 polynomial smoothers are often surprisingly
                 competitive with Gauss-Seidel smoothers on serial
                 machines.}
