  abstract  = {One of the major achievements in engineering science has been the 
               development of computer algorithms for solving nonlinear differential 
               equations such as the Navier-Stokes equations. Limited computer 
               resources have motivated the development of efficient numerical methods 
               in computational fluid dynamics (CFP) utilizing structured meshes. The 
               use of structured meshes greatly simplifies the implementation of CFD 
               algorithms on conventional computers. Structured meshes also permit the 
               use of highly efficient solution techniques such as alternating 
               direction implicit (ADI) iteration schemes or multigrid. Following the 
               dramatic improvement in computing speed, emphasis has shifted towards 
               the design of algorithms capable of treating complex geometries. 
               Unstructured grids offer one promising technique for treating these 
               general geometries. Unstructured meshes have irregular connectivity and 
               usually contain triangles and/or quadrilaterals in two dimensions and 
               tetrahedra and/or hexahedra in three dimensions. The generation and use 
               of unstructured grids poses new challenges in computational fluid 
               dynamics. This is true for both grid generation as well as for the 
               design of algorithms for flow solution. The author presents recent 
               developments in the unstructured grid generation and flow solution technology},
