= ASCEM bibTeX files =

As a simple bookkeeping mechanism we divide the bibliography files
by subject.  This isn't perfect by any stretch, and there may be
better tools for managing bib files, but it's simple and it works.

At the top level we have the abbreviations file:

abbreviations.bib  

Please put journal abbreviations here, and update entries that don't 
use this central list.

The *.bib files are then stored in a subject directory. This allows
for several related files on a subject without making a very large
flat list.  Here we maintain a record of the directories and information
on the subject.  

== Subject Directories ==

ascem              - ASCEM supported publications, manuals, etc.
discretizations    - Mimetic Finite Difference, Finite Volume etc.
models             - flow, transport, biogechemical reaction modeling
sites              - legacy waste sites
software           - links to books, web sites, and repos
solvers            - linear/nonlinear, krylov, direct, and multigrid


The build system will put together the relevant files so you shouldn't
need to have a long list of files.
