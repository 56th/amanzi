=============================================
Amanzi Third Party Library (TPL) Build System
=============================================

Introduction
------------
This project builds the required and optional TPL software for the Amanzi code
project. The build system is designed to configure and build TPLs to the
requirements documented here https://software.lanl.gov/ascem/trac/wiki/Amanzi/Building/SoftwareRequirements.

Users are required to provide the following to build

    * CMake version 2.8.5 or higher.
    * Mercurial version 0.98 or higher.
    * MPI installation with compiler wrappers. (mpicc, mpicxx, etc.)
    * OpenSSL (required to build CURL) installation. This is available on
      most UNIX flavored systems and Macs.
    * BLAS/LAPACK built and tuned to the target architecture. See the 
      Trilinos Configuration section for more information.
    * A location to install all the TPLs. The entire software stack
      will be installed in directories rooted to this directory. Since the
      download--patch-build-install cycle for each TPL is tied to a single  
      target, the user must have read and write permission for this location.
    * The build directory will need approximately 2.1 Gb of space and the 
      install directory tree requires 300 Mb.

Getting TPL-Build
-----------------

TPL-Build is a separate software project that resides in the ASCEM litterbox
repository. Use mercurial to clone a copy of the repository,

``hg clone https://software.lanl.gov/ascem/hg/litterbox``.


Building TPLs
-------------

In most cases, the entire suite of software can be built with the following steps
    1. cmake  \
           -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=/full/path/mpicc \
	   -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/full/path/mpicxx \
	   -D CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=/full/path/mpif90 \
	   -D TPL_INSTALL_PREFIX=/full/path/to/tpls
	   /full/path/to/litterbox/tpl-build
    2. make -j n, where n is the number of make jobs.
    3. make install
    
The final step, make install, copies a CMake configuration file,amanzi-tpl-config.cmake,
to the install location under share/cmake that is useful when building Amanzi. 
Passing this configuration to cmake using the -C option defines all the TPL locations
needed to build amanzi.

For example,

``cmake -C /full/path/to/amanzi-tpl-config.cmake [Additional CMake opts] /full/path/amanzi``

will build and link amanzi linked against the TPLs built with this 
project, reducing the need for complicated build scripts.

Known Issues
------------

Trilinos fails to build with GCC 4.6
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
We are currently using Trilinos 10.6.4 and can not upgrade to a newer
version until the mesh class is upgraded to address changes in STK. The
4.6 GCC compiler is much more picky than previous versions and the
``ptrdiff_t`` definition is found in the ``cstddef.h`` file which is not 
included in several Trilinos header files. The TPL build system has a patch for 
this bug, but is not not enabled by default. To enable the patch,
add -D ENABLE_Trilinos_Patch:BOOL=TRUE to the TPL build cmake configuration
command. 

TPL build fails with any PGI compiler
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
We have not found a PGI C++ compiler that builds our Boost configuration
successfully. TPL build system has successfully built with GCC 4.4, 4.5 and
4.6 and Intel 11.* and Intel 12.*.

Library parallelio (ASCEM-IO) missing archive index (MacOSX)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This bug has only been reported on Macs. Users will experience this bug
when linking the HDF5 test binaries in the Amanzi test suite. Despite a kludge
in the shell script to build ASCEM-IO, this problem presists. The work-around
is to run ranlib on the installed libparallelio.a library.

Fails to locate OpenSSL in the build CURL step
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CURL needs the location of OpenSSL to enable downloads from secure sites.
There is a find_package call in the CURL build definition that attempts
to find the system OpenSSL. If this find fails, define the installation 
location of OpenSSL with ``-D OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR:FILEPATH=<directory>`` when 
configuring and rerun cmake.


Trilinos Configuration
----------------------

Amanzi relies on Trilinos for basic distributed data structures, input file
handling and non-linear solvers. It is critical, for performance reasons, that
the Trilinos build point to tuned BLAS and LAPACK libraries. On most systems,
the BLAS and LAPACK libraries found in standard system libraries
(/usr/lib or /usr/lib64) are generic implementations. Nearly all large class
clusters have tuned BLAS/LAPACK libraries. Please consult the support
documentation for these machines to find the recommended libraries.

Once the tuned BLAS/LAPACK libraries have been identified, the full path name 
of the libraries should be passed in with the configurations variables 
``BLAS_LIBRARIES`` and ``LAPACK_LIBRARIES``. Multiple library names should be 
separated with a semi-colon. Although the tpl-build will pass these names to 
the Trilinos build system, that will not guarantee a smooth Amanzi build. In 
some cases, Intel's MKL libraries, require additional link flags when building 
Amanzi. Use the ``CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS`` configuration variable to define these
additional link flags when building Amanzi. 


Trilinos Build Configuration Files
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

TPL-Build contains Trilinos CMake configuration files for specific platforms and
compilers. The files are located under the tpl-build/cmake directory.
The file name should be defined while configuring tpl-build with the option
``-D Trilinos_Build_Config_File:STRING=<file>``. This configuration file will 
be the last CMake configuration variable passed to Trilinos, thus all the 
definitions in this file will override previous configuration definitions.
