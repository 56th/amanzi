# PFLOTRAN seems to want to call PetscTime() instead of using PetscGetTime(),
# which would require us to use PETSc 3.4.x instead of PETSc 3.2.x, which we 
# currently use. So far, this is the only reason to upgrade.
#
# HOWEVER, PETSc 3.4.x is impossible to build within our fabulous SuperBuild 
# system, so instead of using it, I am making changes to the PFlotran source 
# file option.F90, which uses PetscTime(), and having it use PetscGetTime() 
# instead. This is by far the easiest solution to this problem at the moment.
